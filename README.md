# AI Content Authenticity Detector

A React web application that uses Google Gemini AI to detect fake content in text, images, and videos.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: Analyze news articles, social media posts, and other text content for authenticity
- **Image Detection**: Detect manipulated or deepfake images using AI vision analysis
- **Video Analysis**: Analyze video metadata and provide guidance on potential deepfake content
- **Real-time Processing**: Powered by Google Gemini AI for accurate content analysis
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fake-content-detector
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
```
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
